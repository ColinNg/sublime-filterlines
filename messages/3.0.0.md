3.0.0  January 4, 2015
----------------------

- Now uses Sublime Text 3 plugin search API instead of the Python regular expression module
- Refactored commands to make this plugin easier for others to extend
- Now shows source buffer line numbers (see the new line_numbers preference, off by default)
- Faster for large files


Regular Expression Syntax

Earlier releases used Python regular expression syntax. This release uses Sublime Text search, which implements the Perl regular expression syntax from the Boost library. For more on the Boost Perl syntax, see:
