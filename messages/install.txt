    -----------------------------

    Now you can filter lines in your file that contain a string
    or match a regular expression.

    To filter your file for lines that contain a string:

      Edit > Line > Filter...  (ctrl + shift + f)

    To filter your file for lines that match a regular expression:

      Edit > Line > Filter Using Regular Expression...  (ctrl + option + shift + f)

    On Windows and Linux, use the alt key instead of the option key.
