    Filter Lines is now installed
    -----------------------------

    Now you can filter your file for lines that contain a string
    or match a regular expression

    To filter your file to lines that contain a string or match a regex:

      Edit > Line > Filter With Regex  (cmd + F  cmd + R)
      Edit > Line > Filter With Search  (cmd + F  cmd + S)

    To fold your file to lines that contain a string or match a regex:

      Edit > Code Folding > Fold With Regex  (cmd + K  cmd + R) 
      Edit > Code Folding > Fold With Search  (cmd + K  cmd + S)

    On Windows and Linux, use the ctrl key instead of the cmd key.
